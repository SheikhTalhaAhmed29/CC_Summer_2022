# The Problem We Faced #
The Problem we see in program is validation, if the numbers or charachters are before the "@" or after because the program should accept those special characters and numbers before "" but not after.
Moving on to the question of validating IOS Phone Number. The problem which arose during solving this question was just to add "+" and count the digits because the International Pakistan Phone Number accepts 12 numbers excluding the "+" for example +92xxxxxxxxxxso we had to make sure that we develop a program that satisfies the mentioned conditions.
We solved both of the issues by helping out some videos or flex documentation.
