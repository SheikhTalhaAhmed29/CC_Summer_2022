**The Problem We Face**
The problems we face while solving these questions were that
The program is in validation if the numbers or charachters are before the "@" or after because the program should accept those special characters and numbers before "@" but not after.
Moving on to the question of validating IOS Phone Number. The problem which arose during solving this question was just to add "+" and count the digits because the International Pakistan Phone Number accepts 12 numbers excluding the "+" for example +92xxxxxxxxxxso we had to make sure that we develop a program that satisfies the mentioned conditions.
We solved both of the issues by helping out some videos or flex documentations.
