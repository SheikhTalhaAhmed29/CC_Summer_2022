# Compiler for Mini C to Python
This is a mini compiler for a subset of the C language built as part of our Compiler Construction course.

## Introduction Of Compiler  
A compiler is a program that can read a program in one language - the source language - and translate it to an equivalent program in another language - the target language. An important role of the compiler is to detect any errors in the source program during the translation process  



## 5 Phases of a compiler  
1-Lexical Analysis  
2-Parsing  
3-Semantic Analysis  
4-Code Optimization  
5-Code Generation  

Tasks and Phases related to course are following

| Phase   | Objective                                                                                                                                              |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                                          |
| Phase1 | Select a mini language and finding its specifications                                                                                                  |
| Phase2 | A flex code file (well documented and commented) the takes as input a program in the language we selected in phase 1 and outputs its tokens with video |
| Phase3 | Write YACC code that uses your code from phase 1 and translates a program written in programming language we chose in phase 1 to python code.
